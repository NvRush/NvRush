## Open-Weakness Point
1. Since Codeotus is an Open-source IDE or Preconfigured Terminal Integrated space you may find it to have many features un-available if you are coming from an IDE , that is because Codeotus is aimed to enhance Neovim's features via .lua configuration files & most features are just too complex for a Solo Developer to add. However I am kept on trying to add everything that can enhance Neovim but I have already given a lot by spending not just weeks but months on this! Don't worry Neovim do already have most features & I am sure you probably be never mastering the whole command line in this life. Just enjoy!

2. Codeotus has no Human contributors except me & only Ai contributors like Claude & Chat-Gpt hence some features might take 1-2 days to pop-up.

3. No version control on github - you will only get what I feels good to git.

4. Since it is a bigger Configured Integrated Environment (CIE) hence learning curves could be bigger for initial phase until & unless you get used to Leader-Key-Bindings.

##  Requirements

1. Neovim 0.10 or higher
2. Git
3. ~200 MB of disk space + Bandwidth for initial setup

## Hots 
1. Fixed Bloated unwanted plugins
2. Better nvim-cmp default support for Codeotus
3. blink-cmp for buffer + nvim-cmp support for command line

## ToDo
1. Fix Keymappings
2. Add Workspace

##  Installation

**Clone and install:**

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/Codeotus
cd ~/.config/Codeotus
git clone https://github.com/Codeotus/Codeotus.git .
NVIM_APPNAME=Codeotus nvim
```

**Create a convenient alias:**

```sh
# For Bash users
echo "alias cod='NVIM_APPNAME=Codeotus nvim'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh users
echo "alias cod='NVIM_APPNAME=Codeotus nvim'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can launch Codeotus with just `cod`!

> **Note:** On first launch, you may need to reload your colorscheme with `:colorscheme gruvbox-baby` if themes appear dull.

##  Uninstall

```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/Codeotus/
rm -rf ~/.local/share/Codeotus/
```
