## 📥 Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Create your custom config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/hv

# Navigate to the directory
cd ~/.config/hv

# Clone HurlVim
git clone https://github.com/HornTur/HurlVim.git ~/.config/hv

# Launch HurlVim for the first time
NVIM_APPNAME=hv nvim

# Optional add to zshrc or bashrc and after that source it 
# alias hv='NVIM_APPNAME=hv nvim'



```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `hv` with your preferred directory/launcher name (e.g., `hurlvim`, `hv`, or `mynvim`).

### Setting Up an Alias (Optional but Recommended)

Add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias hv='NVIM_APPNAME=hv nvim'
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh users
```

[!NOTE]
> After the first launch, plugins will install automatically. This may take a minute — be patient and let the magic happen! ✨

---

## 🚦 Getting Started

### First Launch

1. **Initial Setup** — Run `hv` (or your custom alias) for the first time
2. **Plugin Installation** — Wait for automatic plugin installation to complete
3. **Ready to Code** — Start editing with your new supercharged setup!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable ensures HurlVim runs independently from your main Neovim configuration. This means you can test HurlVim without affecting your existing setup!

### Launch Commands

```bash
# Using the full command
NVIM_APPNAME=hv nvim

# Using your alias (if configured)
hv

# Open a specific file
hv myfile.lua
```
